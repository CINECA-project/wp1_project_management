# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, 22 Feb

# TODOs
- CanDIG to follow up with WP3 on choosing a good set of candidate common fields for clinical/phenotypic participant-level data of synthetic data sets
- CanDIG to start AGM slide deck
- CRG to initiate a meeting with HES-SO re: data ingest problems - issues with script from last time - CanDIG, UCT to be invited if they can come
- CRG to continue work on ingestion of genomic data 

# Notes

## Review of TODOs

For next meeting

- CRG to identify/work with WP3 to identfy common fields between synthetic data sets
    - Looks like will be hard to do w/out WP3 involvement
    - Can arrange for the ingest of the variant data
- CanDIG to initiate a meeting w/ SFU about those fields and get ready for data ingestion
    - Will be part of the meeting w/ WP3
- CRG to initiate a meeting with HES-SO re: data ingest problems - issues with script from last time
    - Was waiting on results from common fields - will proceed now
- CanDIG to connect w/ CRG re: permission server
    - In progress

For longer term

- CRG to take upcoming GA4GH Beacon presentation about adding cohort information and turn it into a blog post for CINECA WP6, highlighting how WP1 is “exporting” what we’ve learned and need to GA4GH for wider us
    - In progress
- UTartu to work with CRG on Synthetic UK data (or open 1000 genomes RNAseq data) to augment with needed metadata
    - No report



## Demo Planning

20 min demo:
- Beacon works with beacon network
    - In progress
- Subset of synthetic data set fields
    - In progress
- Plan for incorporating more fields
    - In slides
- Works w/ WP2 authentication
    - Open, controlled; registered?
- Lighting CINECA beacon document status
    - In progress
- Maybe a demo of not-yet-GA4GH Search on one dataset if time permits


## Next meetings
- Feb 23 - WPL meeting
- Feb 24 - End-to-end demo planning meeting
- Mar 8 - WP1 call
