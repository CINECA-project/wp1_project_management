# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, Jan 27

## Agenda:

### Tasks: https://github.com/orgs/cineca-wp1/projects/1

* Colaus WP3-formatted Beacon
    - Shared sample, shuffled, CoLaus data shared w/ EBI (apart from variants)
        - Disease is free text → normalize
        - Created minimal map in terms of attributes
        - Shared data set and data dictionary 
        - Work on mapping key columns to Phenopackets resources/classes
        - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1ZXqTMIhFtGOaodw7Fns5YghvY_pWos-RuSa2BFnO5l4/edit
        - WP3: “We have converted CoLaus data into minimal data model format. We will be able to share this data and json schema for minimal data model soon.”
        - Questions integrating into beacon?  WP3 ↔ Beacon team work necessary to ensure beacon implementation can handle evolving WP3 schema

* CanDIG "Search in a Box" implementation
    - Beginning; will start repository

* Additional Discovery Search implementation for Demo
    - On hold while implementation is built.
    - Federation will be more complicated; having 2 Search cohorts for March may not be significantly more useful than 1.

* CanDIG beacon AAI interoperability
    - Working w/ WP2

* Cohort Pseudodata from CHILD
    - WP3, CHILD teams are working on it; very interested to seer results from WP3/CoLaus collaboration

* CHILD pseudo data reference beacon stood up
    - holding on pseudodata above

* CHILD pseudo data reference search stood up
    - holding on pseudodata above

* CINECA Beacon Network
    - Up and running, ready for beacons to network

* EGA Beacon (H3Africa)
    - Working to get access

* Other (non-CINCEA) cohort plans for participating:
    - UMCG - plan for genome of the netherlands - may be possible but will take work
    - Will report back on likelihood
    - EGA - working for a while on incorporating summary public data (Tables, beacons); could work togethre


### Monthly WPL meeting

* Interest in having a single CINECA Github org
    - WP1 is furthest along, plan is to rename WP1 org and reorganize repos
    - Project would draft common guidelines for use, including clear (but not necessarily uniform?) licensing
    - Public repos by default, may be cost involved for private

* Discussed goals for CINECA Midterm Review (Oct).  Goals suggested for WP1:
    - Core Goals
        - Beacon V1 network demonstrator across one Canadian, one European, and one African cohort (WP3 dependency)
        - Search API for 2 cohorts with a subset of synthetic cohort data reflecting initial use cases
    - Stretch Goals
        - Beacon V1 for three Canadian, three European, and one African cohort
        - Beacon V2 network across one Canadian, one European, and one African cohort 
        - Registered access individual level queries for one Canadian, one European, and one African cohort (WP2 dependency)
        - Controlled access individual level queries for one Canadian, one European, and one African cohort (WP2 dependency)
        - Demo of CINECA discovery portal
    - Potential blockers
        - Beacon V2 specification not stable or published or adopted before the mid term
        - Search API not stable or published or adopted before the mid term
        - WP3 meta data not available, use synthetic meta data where needed (confirmed for CHILD cohort study) 


### Next meeting

* Feb 10 WP1 call, usual time/zoom channel
