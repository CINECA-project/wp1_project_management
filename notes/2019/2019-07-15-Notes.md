# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, 15 July

## Notes


* Report back from meetings with other WPs:
   - WP 3
      - The API declaring the schema of the provided data is adequate “loose coupling” for WP3
   - WP 4
      - We should aim towards (a) GA4GH standards for, e.g., data URIs or fields, and (b) definable structure, in API responses
      - Will work on a data flow diagram connecting WPs 1,2,4


* Review the API/criteria matrix: [matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15BvIHHvQPtOxaL2xYZ4GI-ntZijIcUIaz2z4z-TGMlg/edit#gid=0)
   - Beacon - mature, work needed but can handle many discovery queries
   - Search - evolving; complex queries are straightforward, IR queries doable


- Make decisions about APIs for M12 and M18
    - Decided to proceed with Beacon for “Basic Queries”, M12
    - Provisional decision to go proceed with GA4GH Discovery Search for M18 queries, informed by other work (Molgenis, SwissEGA)


## Upcoming

Following call:

- [29 July](#) as usual
    - Implementation plan for Beacon services
    - Steps towards M18 goals: extended queries and service registry
