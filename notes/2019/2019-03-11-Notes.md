# CINECA WP1 telecon: 11 Mar 2019

## Notes

* Queries use cases
    - Google doc: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KXpdgtDf0RRAyga6EJfBSxbUwAV0oR_DGP9R9-42D84/edit
    - Distill requirements/use cases:
        - To support by M12 (discovery)
        - To support by M18 (extended queries)
        - Will not support
    - Action item for all participants - contribute to/update doc, will review next meeting
       - Need to to balance 2 things:
           - implementatability by M12
           - extensibility to full “extended queries” by M18 
       - How hard are requirements from WP5?
           - Jonathan D to discuss w/ WP5 lead
       - Month 12 “all” cohorts have discovery searches are supported?
           - Update: (1) Not explicit about all cohorts supported by M12, and (b) is the end of a sub task (1.1.1) but is not actually a Milestone

* Risk Register
    - Are asked to double-check our listed risks for the initial risk register, and rate on two 1-5 scales
        - Probability (Improbable/Could happen/As likely as not/Probable/Highly probable)
        - Severity (Insignificant/Marginal/Serious/Critical/Catastrophic)
    - The risks and their scores are expected to change over time

    - Risk: Difficulty coming to agreement on API definitions/standards (e.g., failed Discovery Search API effort) in time to meet implementation deadlines - Probability: 2-3/5, Severity 3-4/5 (consequence - timeline slips of items)
        - Mitigation: Start simple (MVP) and iterate between partners; don’t attempt standardization until well along path 
    - Risk: Problems with technical interoperability of implementations (note: not semantic interoperability): 
        - Mitigation: API-first approach (OpenAPI), build from there. Continuous interoperability testing during development (aided by API-first). Prob 2/5, Severity 2/5
    - *NEW* Risk: semantic interoperability of implementations hindered by delay in delivery, implementation of data and metadata standards.  Prob 3/5, Severity 2/5
        - Mitigation: ensure technical implementations remain relatively agnostic to the underlying semantics, work closely with WP3
    - Risk: New data types/services emerge which are not yet supported by APIs: 2/5, 2/5
        - Mitigation: Lightweight search/query APIs that can “wrap” low-level queries. Focus on extensibility from begining; very compatible with start simple + iterate

* Updates from other groups:
    - CINECA WP2
        - Survey to go out to cohorts about authorization polices
        - Initial picture for CanDIG/ELIXIR AAI interoperability
    - Other WPs?
        - WP3 - no update
        - WP4 - no update
        - WP5 - no update

* Beacon roadmap
    - https://beacon-project.io/categories/roadmap.html
    - Beacon flavors 
        - Evidence beacons
        - Data beacons
    - Clinical vs aggregate beacons
        - Multivalued responses - schema-block like results
        - And-logic for additional filtering
        - handover for data delivery
        - adoption for CNVs, proteomics
        - Non-human data

* Next call
    - Mar 25, 14h
    - Will revisit use cases listed in google document
    - Plans for discovery search, other relevant search APIs pending speaker availability
