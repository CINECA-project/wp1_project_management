# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, Dec 16

## TODOs:

- Still need updates from other sites: UMCG, UTartu, CSC
- Sites participating in March to line up cohorts & data

## Notes:

### Followup from last meeting’s TODOs:
- Work Package lead to contact each site for very brief (~1 paragraph) description of their beacon implementation
    - Outstanding:  CSC, MCG, UTARTU, UMCG
    - Lead will combine responses into WP1 status document

### Sites present current Beacon implementation status/plans

- CanDIG: 
    - Beacon 1 tied into existing infrastructure, nearly complete
    - Standalone Beacon 2 (working on AAI)
- EGA
    - Beacon 2 updates - developing the spec & implementation
    - Working w/ cohorts to request access to data
    - Beacon network ready for CINECA
    - Service registry available beacon network - GA4GH compatible; would be hosted at EGA

### Agenda for coming months

- WP1/3 Demo (M16)
    - Need: 3 sites + cohorts willing to:
        - Map cohort data (real or synthetic) to WP3 standard
        - Expose beacon
        - Attempt integration into a custom Beacon Network
            - CanDIG/CHILD(?)
            - EGA/To Be Determined
            - SPHN/CoLaus
    - Need: 1-2 sites + cohorts willing to 
        - Map cohort data (real or synthetic) to WP3 standard - can re-use work from above
        - Stand up Discovery Search
    - Demo will be topic of WP1-4 coordination meeting mid Jan 2020
- MS1.1/D1.1 Service Registry Implementation (M18) - service registry
    - Will have to implement and stand up at least one service registry: https://github.com/ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-service-registry
        - Very simple
        - Ideally distributed but could just have one for now
        - “Built in” to Beacon network
- T1.1.2 Extended Queries (M18) - Search
- MS1.2/D1.3 Federated discovery across registry services (M24)
    - March demo would go a long way to this milestone
