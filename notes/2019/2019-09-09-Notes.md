# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, Sept 9

## Notes

### Sites present current implementation plans and status

- CanDIG: 
    - Developer implementing Beacon v1 from OpenAPI spec to connect to existing queries
    - Expect to have something to talk about/demo next meeting
- SIB/SPHN: 
    - Current docker version of beacon up and running w/ test data
    - Just got CoLaus genetic data
    - Will implement simple queries on top of genetic data
        - Will use supplied docker infrastructure (PostgreSQL) for data
    - Cohort wide access
- EGA:
    - Making publishing data via Beacon easier for cohort owners

### Sites review how much functionality is feasible/prioritized by Dec

- Experience is that standing up particular queries is not a lot of work
- WP3: most cohorts should have basic patient demographics, a diagnosis
- Priorities for December:
    - Basic genomic data
    - demographics
    - phenotype where available
    - filtering
    - access levels
    - Handover
- Can take incremental approach
- Much easier if use supplied beacon docker infrastructure + ReST API service and connect services to that
- M12: WP1 task is simply to have all sites individually allowing the same “basic queries”.

## Upcoming Meetings

We will focus next meeting or two on Beacon implementation progress, then start considering M18/M24 tasks (federation, interoperability, extended queries)

### Next meeting

- Sept 23, usual time/zoom channel
