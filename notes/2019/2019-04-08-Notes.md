       - Plan for AGM in May 2020
       - WP3 working on a proposal early, will be relevant for us
   - WP2
        - Survey to cohorts out
        - Aim for meeting in September to implement interoperability
   - WP3
        - ERA/CRG reports: Trying to get metadata details from cohorts
   - WP4
        - No representatives
   - WP5
        - SIB: Have a cohort data with similar data
        - Setting up infrastructure to support the cohort
        - Interested in backend
        
* Query Prioritization
   - Cases google doc: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KXpdgtDf0RRAyga6EJfBSxbUwAV0oR_DGP9R9-42D84/edit
   - Entities:
       - Genomic Data:
           - Variants, with annotations
               - Gene, Pathway
               - Type, Consequence
               - Germline/Somatic (sample)
           - RNA Expression
           - Samples associated if any
           - Patients associated if any
       - Samples:
           - Tissue
           - Type
           - Genomic data, Patients associated if any
       - Patient Clinical/Phenotypic:
           - Demographic info
           - Phenotypes
           - Diseases
           - Treatments
           - Outcomes
           - Samples associated if any
           - Genomic data associated if any
   - Requirements:
       - Clin/Phen + Variants needed for short term WP5 use cases
       - Clin/Phen + Samples needed for biobanking use cases
       - Biobanking use cases will also have needs for information-retrieval type queries
       - Not all data sets will have all fields
       - Make use of existing query infrastructure
       - Discovery searches (return ids/urls) for Dec 2019, complex return types for Jun 2020
   - Proposal Prioritization:
       - Postpone RNA expression data until M18
           - GA4GH API/standard matrix format should be well established by then
       - Postpone information retrieval queries until M18
           - But need to keep in mind for design
           - Need information about what a "good" IR API looks like?
       - Start with single entities
           - Variant sets with variants in gene X
           - Patients with phenotype Y
       - Proceed to linked entities by M12
           - Patients with variants in gene X
           - Samples from patients with phenotype Y and variants in pathway Z
       - Evaluate beacon vs search APIs for these cases
           - Regardless of API, possible backends (proposed by GA4GH Discovery Search API):
               - Presto (https://prestodb.github.io)
               - GraphQL (https://graphql.org)
               - CanDIG to have FHIR/Variants demo for end of April
       - Other projects are evaluating APIs including:
            - FAIR data point
            - DataShield
        - Should consider those?

    * Broad agreement on prioritization as an initial proposal
        - Jonathan Dursi to forward to WPs 3, 5 leaderships for feedback

    * Next steps:
        - Apr 15: discuss back ends
            - PRESTO/GraphQL for connecting across existing services
            - Site back ends

        - Next meeting:
            - May 6?  Earlier?
            - API evaulation: Beacon, Search, possibly others

## Upcoming

* Next call
   - Apr 15 13h00

* GA4GH Connect Implementation meeting
   - Apr 29/30
   - CanDIG will be there if anyone wants to arrange a meeting
