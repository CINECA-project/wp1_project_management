# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, Nov 4

## TODOs

* WP lead:
    - To arrange kickoff meeting w/ WP3 on coordination, then ensure there is a standing agenda item on WP1 meetings for WP1/WP3 coordination
    - To forward GA4GH Plenary meeting report to WP1 list when available
    - To arrange for Discovery Search interaction for Nov 18 or Dec 2 meeting
* Beacon team:
    - To forward draft Beacon 2 spec even if incomplete when ready for CINECA partners to engage with it
* WP1 implementors:
    - To continue Beacon v1 implementation with eye towards including Beacon v2 functionality as soon as possible, even if only as info fields

## Notes

### GA4GH Plenary:

* CINECA session
    - Discussion of Metadata
    - GA4GH & APIs: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/162XC7-Duj4Vwkr74rFNHFn5w2fHVTGmM_9tC5d5cyxg/edit?usp=sharing
    - Many discussions of interaction between APIs: particular discovery APIs: beacon/case discovery/search
        - Possible merger case discovery/beacon 2?
        - Will require a full spec for Beacon 2 - will occur over next weeks 
* Beacon discussions
    - WP2 development as we heard last meeting
* Search Discussions
    - Approach converging

### WP1/WP3:

* Will need to coordinate on the metadata returned by Discovery APIs
    - Some overlap w/ WP3 already 
    - Standing agenda items on each WP?
    - Kickoff meeting, then standing agendas?

### WP1/WP2/WP4 Discussions:

* Handoff, interoperability
    - WP1/WP2 interaction fairly clear currently (due to using beacon)
    - WP1/WP4 interaction further downstream
    - Add standing agenda items in 2020

### Sites present current implementation plans and status

* CanDIG: 
    - Beacon v1.0.1 in golang from OpenAPI spec to connect to existing query engines
    - https://github.com/candig/beacon
* SIB/SPHN: 
    - First implementation running - beacon reference implementation w/ CoLaus
        - Phenopackets mapping: not all information can be mapped, how to proceed
            - Info field in Beacon 1, directly useful in Beacon 2
            - Can be feedback to WP3, Phenopackets/GA4GH clin-phen group
    - Can’t return fewer than 12 responses (data masking; k-anonymity)
    - Current spec implemented, looking for guidance on next version
    - DUO terminology
        - Should be relatively straightforward if informed consent information is available, and if that information isn’t available, should find a way to get access to it for CINECA
        - ELSI team will likely ask for such information to be made available
* CRG:
    - Process: writing spec for Beacon 2.0; currently about 60% done
    - Probably won’t be an official standard until Q2 2020
    - Can work with beta version?
    - Suggestion to work with draft, provide feedback
    - Some CINCEA partners will probably have to engage at different stages
    - Consistent w/ draft metadata standards
        - Beacon network just for CINECA?
* Estonian biobanks:
    - Beacon 1 up and running
    - One conversation w/ WP3 re: metadata, esp. concerning RNAseq
