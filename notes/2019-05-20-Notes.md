# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, 20 May 2019

## Notes

* WP3 plans and needs: Tony Burdett & Melanie Courtot,  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r-QV8Anz4lQJ_qqghGs24Uhlv1QdJJuaWCIZRjq3VrM/edit?usp=sharing
    - Would like: "API and standards evolve independently, reach an awesome solution"
        - Loose coupling, so WP3 harmonization and WP1 development can each progress somewhat independentnly
        - Search clients need to know what they can search for
        - Implementers need to know how to expose searches
        - Data providers must map to an agree standard
        - Standards must be flexible to cover all use cases
        - Standards must be flexible to cover all important cohort information
   - Previous experiences:
        - Biosamples DB: metadata standards problem
        - ~ power law distribution of attribute usage
        - 60% of attributes cover only 5% of metadata
        - How to avoid blocking WP1 while ongoing metadata harmonization happens?
        - Productive way to go forward: don’t tightly couple WP1 API to WP3 metadata
        - Biosamples: search by key-value pairs
    - Start w/ something agnostic to terms, build higher level queries, mappings on top of that
    - As standardization/harmonization progresses, can shift mappings from client to server without changing API, breaking code changes
    - Q & A
        - Q: In this model, which WP has the responsibility for exposing the mappings? A: likely involves both
        - Q: Would having a simple search API available actually help the WP3 harmonizers?  A: Yes, it can, both directly and by showing which attributes/use cases are most often queried
        - Q: Longitudinal data?  A: Have to do “bottom up” work to establish possibilities & use cases from exemplars.  Additional exemplars welcome.
        - Q: Is there some initial set of “easily” harmonized items? A: WP3 can provide a version 0.1 of a metadata standard soon-ish; but even terms defined in that 0.1 may change
    
* Review of query prioritization:
     - https://github.com/cineca-wp1/project_management/blob/master/queries.md
     - Note: doesn't currently explicitly describe longitudinal data
     - Seems reasonable 


* Getting back to a regular call schedule post Easter & Hinxton
     - Every 2nd Monday
     - Next meetings: 3 June, 17 Jun, 1 Jul...
     - Will reschedule individual meetings as necessary to deal with holidays
