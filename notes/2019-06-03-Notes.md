# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, 3 June 2019

## Notes

Review of relevant APIs in context of WP3 needs and our queries

WP3:

- Strongly prefers loosely coupled (*e.g.*, key-value search; “key=age;value>20”)
- Allows independence between evolving terminology/metadata harmonization and technical API development

Our query prioritization (informed by WP5 and others):

- https://github.com/cineca-wp1/project_management/blob/master/queries.md

APIs

- GA4GH Discovery Search (Marc Fiume)
- GA4GH Beacon (Jordi)
- SPHN/SIB/HESSO Search API (Douglas Teodoro)
- Cafe Variome (Fleur)

**Discovery Search (New Search):**
Emerging work stream search standard

- Common, lower-level search API across many data types
- Searching across different types of data
- Doesn’t prescribe data models, but will support GA4GH data models (e.g., Schemablocks - work led by Michael Baudis)
- Backend-agnostic; federation
- *Not* developing data models; *not* creating their own query language; does *not* prescribe a specific application.  Aims to support multiple applications “on top” of the Search API
- Use cases:
    - Find subjects w/ HP:0001519 and candidate gene FBN1 (MME use case)
    - Find male subjects w/ HP:009726 consented for general research use (use case of EPA)
    - etc.
- 3 endpoints: 
    - `/datasets`: describes searchable datasets
    - `/schemas`; describes schemas of datasets
    - `/search`: perform query
- SQL queries: JSON-SQL
- Schemas: JSON-Schema with extensions (`x-unit` for units of numeric properties, `x-standard`: urn to standardized properties)
- Reference server implementation using PRESTOdb
- Example of handoff to WES

**HES-SO/SIB**
Search & Discovery work; part of my health, my data

- DATS/BD2K:  data catalogue schema
- DAta Tag Suite (DAS) standards
    - DCAT/W3C compatable
    - Platform-independent model
    - Annotated serialization in schema.org
    - Papers include - Gonzalez-Beltran, A.N., 2017 - Data discovery w/ DATS: examplar adoptions and lessons, learned.  JAMIA
    - More about information-retrieval type queries
    - Lucene-based APIs/ElasticSearch
    - meta-data generation based on data ingestion/normalisation API, see WP3
    - Catalog query types: boolean operators, grouping, field grouping, wildcard
- Ingestion API into DATS model using match terms
- Normalization on ingest
- Search based on lucene
- Search can have “must/must_not” and “should/should_not”, allows information retrieval-type queries
- Sites expose their metadata using DCAT, concept using UMLF
- API vs Implementation?
    - The API is a thin layer on top of Lucene
    

**Beacon**

- Allows for non-allelic queries: “genes”, “protein”
- Allow for adding simple conditions/filters to the queries
    - Phenotype, genotype, variant annotation
- Provide more information about the results
    - Counters, frequencies, variant annotations, variant effects
- Provide “next steps” after discovery
    - Contact owner for access
    - Get case details
    - Download the data
- Designed to be extensible, upgradable
- Beacon 2:
    - Keep query request/response as is for backward compatibility - `/query` endpoint
    - Allowing for focused query types:
        - GenomicsSNP
        - GenomicsSV
        - GenomicRegion
        - ProteomicsSAV
        - ProteomicsPTM
    - Internally, map old query to new focused endpoints
    - Clearly state support and access level for each dataset+feature
        - `/access_levels`
    - Filtering: extension to each beacon query
        - AND boolean logic exclusively
        - Leverages ontologies
        - New endpoint to declare which filter terms are implemented/declared
        - Backend should know the mapping between ontology term and “data base column”
        - (Not full query language - filtering only, no OR logic, for instance - but allows much simpler API/syntax/implementation)
- Handover mechanism - included in beacon 1.1
- Evidence beacon

**Cafe Variome Connector**
Next week


## Upcoming

* Next call:
     - TBD - reschedule around ELIXIR all hands
     - To discuss:
         - Cafe Variome Connector
         - Rubric for ranking possible APIs:
             - Ease of implementing widely
             - Would sites implement it anyway?
             - Matching up against prioritized queries
             - Matching it up against downstream WP needs
* Following call:
     - 1 July as usual
