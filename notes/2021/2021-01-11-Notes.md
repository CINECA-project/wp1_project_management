# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, 11 Jan

## TODOs

* EGA to follow-up and get calendar/list of current offerings so we can design our own training 
* CRG to follow up with HES-SO, make sure they’re invited to CHILD/beacon meeting and get notes relevant to their work with synthetic data generated by CoLaus
* CanDIG to have initial working permission server
* Attendees to report back on cross-workpackage meeting, synthetic data meeting, CHILD/beacon meeting

# Notes

## Review of TODOs

* WP6 to send us a list of what is current training offerings are so we can judge a useful time
    - EGA to follow-up and get calendar/list of current offerings so we can design our own training 
* HES-SO to propose a couple of training possibilities - could be as simple as a technical report or a video of a slightly longer technical walkthrough
* After that, HES-SO, CRG will plan for future training, possibly more interactive, with both query expansion + Beacon
    - Both pending information from WP6
    - Likely some time after end-to-end demo in March - April at earliest
* CanDIG to finish getting poc.distributedgenomics.ca beacon back up and running (pending from last meeting)
    - Done - https://poc.distributedgenomics.ca:5061
* CanDIG to finish initial ga4gh passport permission server (pending from last meeting)
    - In progress.  CanDIG to follow up with CRG re: 
* HES-SO to get beacon back up and running (pending from last meeting)
    - Beacon up and running - https://beacon.text-analytics.ch/
    - UK Biobank data - need to look at what’s necessary for CoLaus data
* CRG to continue work developing mapping into beacon data model, ontologies, for synthetic data set developed by CHILD cohort team
    - In progress; will report at meeting later this week
    - HES-SO to join as well (or review notes) 

## Planning for first half of 2021

* End-to-end demos - ~March 2021: Authenticated, authorized access to federated beacon, with handoff to upstream WPs
    - Synthetic data generated by CHILD in beacon hosted on CanDIG
    - Synthetic data generated by Colaus in beacon hosted @ HES-SO
    - Synthetic data generated by H3Africa in beacon hosted @ UCT
    - At each beacon,
        - Data mapped
        - Data ingested
        - Cohort metadata provided
        - Permission server understanding ga4gh passports deployed
        - Authorization implemented to enable registered (via passport), controlled, or open access as needed
    - Same data also provided by Search for one or more cohorts
    - Beacon network connecting all beacons
    - Service registry served by beacon network
    - Plan for handoff of beacon results to WPs4,5
    - Complete documentation for standing up CINECA WP1 APIs for other CINECA cohorts
        - CINECA beacon [quickstart](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnZac4z6FiiiHSW5GXyMd-yOydqLU6aXEsEZ0ikz5nA/edit)

* Need documentation and persistent infrastructure as we put this together
    - Demo should be a demo of functionality that persists and is replicable after the demo

* Outreach:
    - Blog series upcoming months on implement for GA4GH standards - anyone interested in how this applies to WP1 (plan is to publish 1/mo) 
        - CRG could talk about the Beacon; what the process for Beacon 2 standardization looks like 
        - After successful GA4GH steering committee vote, CanDIG to follow up with Search API team to start a blog post on that process, could then add implementing it in WP1
        - Future blog post - Worth trying to get extending service registry to include cohort information
            - Would show CINECA contributing to GA4GH standards, beyond just implementation

* Jan 13 - Synthetic data meeting
* Jan 15 - CHILD/beacon meeting
* Jan 25 - Next WP1 meeting
    - Report back on synthetic data meetings
