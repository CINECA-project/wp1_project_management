# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, 21 June 2019

## Notes

- Big picture:
    - Have decided on queries based on downstream WP needs
    - Have heard about collaborating WP, WP3’s, needs
    - Have gotten an overview of a number of potential APIs
    - This meeting: heard about final API, figure out how we’ll decide WP1 API - criteria, process
    - July 1st: Begin to apply rubric to APIs
    - July 15: apply rubric to APIs, make decision for remainder of 2019
    - Rest of 2019 - implementation of APIs; begin to prepare list of services available


- Cafe Variome Connector
    - [https://www.cafevariome.org/](https://www.cafevariome.org/)
    - Discovery for rare disease
    - Data is not normalized
    - Shared context - rare disease
    - Map metadata, data, technology
    - github.com/vl62/uol-open_discovery_specification (component-based API)
        - Swagger API 
    - Example of standing up - deb-central.org : patients, mutations
        - [https://deb-central.org/api/v2/Patients](https://deb-central.org/api/v2/Patients)
    - Adapter - mapping of metadata fields on top of queries
    - Nested query language
        - E.g:
    {
      "query": {
        "components": {
          "eav": [
            {
              "attribute": "sex",
              "operator": "is",
              "value": "m"
            },
            {
              "attribute": "phenotype",
              "operator": "is",
              "value": "hp:0008066"
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "logic": {
        "-OR": [
          "/query/components/eav/0",
          "/query/components/eav/1"
        ]
      }
    }
    - Phenotype, patient demographics, variants
    - Rancher environment to start up quickly:
        - [https://rancher.molgenis.org:7777/p/c-5vzd9:p-dd77v/apps](https://rancher.molgenis.org:7777/p/c-5vzd9:p-dd77v/apps)
        - [https://cv.dev.molgenis.org/](https://cv.dev.molgenis.org/)
    
- Quick review of APIs:
    - Discovery Search
    - HES-SO/SIB work - Swiss EGA
    - Beacon
    - Cafe Variome, Connector
    - RSQL
        
- Criteria for ranking APIs:
    - Our queries, informed by WP5 needs: https://github.com/cineca-wp1/project_management/blob/master/queries.md
    - Allow wide range of non-prescribed queries
        - M12 examples:
            - Samples corresponding to patients with disease X and variants in gene Y
                - return list of sample identifiers
            - Patients with disease X and variants in gene Y that have samples of tissue Z available
                - return list of patient identifiers
        - M18 examples:
            - More complex return values
                - histogram of counts, min/max, etc
            - Include RNA expression
            - Deeper clin/phen fields, in collaboration w/ WP3
                - include capabilities for treatments, outcomes, lab work, references to other data
            - Hypothesis-driven association query: contingency table of phenotype X vs mutations in gene Y
            - Patients with disease X and mutations in gene Y with RNA expression data available in gene Y
            - Histogram of variants in pathway X in patients with phenotype Y by counts; or by consequence
            - Counting of patients in registry with a specific rare disease
    - WP3 needs
        - loose coupling between API + metadata fields
        - Clear place to implement mapping
    - Ease of implementing: technical feasibility upon existing infrastructure/APIs
    - Already on sites roadmaps
    - GA4GH alignment
    - Proof of feasibility/usefulness

- Next week
    - Begin matching up API/service to the criteria above
        - Representatives for most/each API/service to walk through criteria
    - Following week, complete evaluation based on questions arising
        - Decide on an API to start implementing

## Upcoming
