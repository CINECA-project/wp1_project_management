# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, Dec 2

## Followup from last meeting’s TODOs:

- Work Package lead to contact each site for very brief (~1 paragraph) description of their beacon implementation
    - Doing now
    - Lead will combine responses into WP1 status document

## Agenda

### WP3 Coordation items:

Towards a demo for March AGM

- Get feedback whether approach is useful to downstream: WP1 + WP3
- Beacon, Search
    - Beacon Demo:
        - 2-3 sets of data (possibly synthetic) pulled into local reference beacon implementations
        - Mapped into minimal meta data standards
            - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZXqTMIhFtGOaodw7Fns5YghvY_pWos-RuSa2BFnO5l4/
        - Emit metadata via phenopackets
        - Colaus (?), synthetic CHILD (?), EGA (?)
            - CoLaus - sounds good
        - ELIXIR AAI - CoLaus may have AAI
        - Could have as demo - beacon network?
            - Sabela: CINECA Beacon network should be feasible
    - Search Demo
        - Similar with 1-2 Search implementations

- Could involve WP2 with interoperable authentication
    - Colaus/SIB: Uses ELIXIR AAI?


### WP1/3/4/5 coordination items:

- Make sure WP3 products (and WP1) meet downstream WP needs

### Discovery Search:

- Presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qu8N0H6UWGVusf69tL34AVaDDUhgkwYAjnK_4sqLsn0
- What’s changed in the last 6 months
    - Use cases - variant analysis, data discovery, patient discovery, clinical records
    - Trying to accomplish:
        - Respect patient consent & privacy
        - Allow discovery of new data sets
        - Without presupposing use case
        - Tools work together seamlessly
    - Search & Tables API:
        - Large number of clients, large number of data sources
        - Benefits of a common API
    - API:
        - Get list of tables: GET /tables
        - Get structural info about a table: GET /table/{table_name}/info
            - Return JSON schema (draft 7) data model
            - Can refer to *e.g.* schemaBlocks data model
        - Get first page of data in a table: GET /table/{table_name}/data
        - Next page via HATEOAS: e.g., GET /table/{table_name}_paegs/3
        - Search (execute SQL query): POST /search, get table back
-  How to get started with search
    - Get familiar with tables & JSON schemas
        - Static tables - try describing a few data sets with JSON schema
            - Use open source tables-api-cli to convert data
            - Upload to web server or cloud bucket
            - That’s a tables implementation!
        - Dynamic table
            - Serve data using a web service that translates to JSON on the fly
    - Get familiar w/ PrestoSQL
        - PostgreSQL or MySQL
        - Or non-SQL datasource (MongoDB, elasticsearch)
        - Google sheets?
        - Start on machine
        - Try setting up a cluster
- Reasonable paths to having search impl in ~6 mos
    - GA4GH Search adapter for Presto
        - Will be open source in next few weeks
    - Interoperability across data sets
        - Start at attribute level
        - Focus on codifying straightforward attributes - subject, id, sex
        - Lean on existing efforts
        - Recommendation: publish JOSON schemas separately, refer to them with $ref
    - AAI:
        - Not part of spec
        - Would probably lean on GA4GH Passports
- How to engage with Discovery search
    - Biweekly calls - next is wed, Dec 11 @ 11 Toronto time
    - GitHub repo: (github/ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-discovery-search) create or comment on issues
- Unexplored Future directions
    - Full text search
    - Fuzzy term matching
    - Provenance in Table data structure
- Questions: is spec available?
    - On repo - spec/search-api.yml
    - Is there a “search-in-a-box” repo?
        - Not yet but pieces exist - incl docker containers
    - Where best to do data mapping?  API adapter, Presto connector, computed columns?
        - Currently in API server, could do it in the connector
    - Could get some help w/ JSON schema for WP3 minimal metadata standard 
    - SQL queries on google sheets?
        - Yes, w/ PRESTO connector
    - Relationship between this and beacon?
        - From Search point of view:
            - Beacon: To be as open/simple as possible, constrained use case/language
            - Search: Much less constrained use case/search language, less open, less simple queries
                - More fundamental: could be used by upstream APIs like beacon


## Next meeting

- **Dec 16, WP1 Call**, usual time/zoom channel
