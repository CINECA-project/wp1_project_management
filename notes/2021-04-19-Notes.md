# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, 19 Apr

# TODOs
- HES-SO to raise issue w/ WP5 members on what needs to be done for MS1.4, handoff to WP5.2, and report back next meeting
- UHN/SickKids, CRG to put together list of next steps for lighting a CINECA Beacon document, will report back next meeting
- CRG to send McGill links to active beacons to get familiar with the API and responses in preparation for initial tech demo for portal
- UHN/SickKids to deprecate disused CanDIG WP1 project board in favour of Gantt chart

# Decisions
- A major focus of the next year will be engaging cohorts and sites, and providing them the tools they need to work with their own data sets to light beacons, etc
- WP1 will work towards a single hosted portal, but with two teams working on complementary functionality

# Notes

## Welcome, Introductions
- McGill representative Gordon Krieger

## Review of AGM
- From SAB/CINCEA Project Management’s point of view:
    - SAB was broadly quite positive; wanted more engagement with stakeholders
    - Short report will be forthcoming
    - Will be a minor budget reallocation towards UCT - will support beacon work
    - Interest re: benefit sharing in making it easier to stand up beacons internally
- Retrospective from WP1 point of view
    - Bit of a scramble in month before AGM, much fell on CRG team
        - Part of this was due to unfortunate timing - Beacon v2 development and preparation for submission overlapping with AGM; shouldn’t recur
        - Also a lot of work on handling data mapping with WP3; this would recur unless we can give the cohorts the documentation and knowledge to handle it on their own.  This is the only scalable way forward, and they are the ones that know their data best.
        - WP1/WP3 collaboration discussions (see below) should help with this
    - Interest in, and possibility for, new Canadian Cohort for participation

## Dynamic Gantt Chart for WP1 tasks
- CRG has put together a Gantt Chart [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FH1RsAP1Pf8hNX6kZj9H-J7p3BEgwNVppVq0O8pKXRg/edit)
- Will track progress using this chart for future meetings

## Update on Discussion w/ WP3 on Mapping
- CRG, WP3 working on improving documentation, clarity on mapping data from WP3 Minimal Metadata Model in to Beacon/phenopackets: in-progress document [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dyPduywYRy_WR52vjDneHRPyq_JdRArngFeReQktnsY/edit).
- Discussions and updates will continue

## Update on Training Materials - due Month 30 (June)
- CRG meeting w/ WP6 on requirements
- Note that WP6 has long turnaround for review, youtube posting requests - incorporate several week delay into schedule
- Will ask about beacon, query expansion trainings
- If any of the materials are intended for a developer audience, can use new McGill developer as test audience

## Update on MS1.4, Handoff to WP5.2 - due Month 30 (June)
- HES-SO to report back next meeting

## Ongoing - Lighting a Beacon Document
- CRG, UHN will discuss next steps and report back next meeting
