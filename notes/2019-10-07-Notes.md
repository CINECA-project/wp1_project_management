# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, Oct 7

## Notes

### Sites present Beacon implementation plans and status
- CanDIG: 
    - Beacon v1.0.1 in go from OpenAPI spec to connect to existing query engines
    - https://github.com/candig/beacon
    - Not yet deployed
- SIB/SPHN: 
    - Questions about what would be available last time
    - Can have demographic and some diagnosis information available
    - Don't provide answers with fewer than 12 results (e.g., k-anonymity)

### Status of Beacon v2 API
- 2.0 draft API coming together
- Going beyond variants to calls, samples, patients, limiting to disease, gene, tissue
- Information about effect of the mutation, phenotypes, handoff 
- Finer-grained authorization
- No longer having a single endpoint
- More classical ReST API and entity queries: lists, individual entities; filtering; linked entities (at least to one level)
- Unstable/open entity schemas: few approaches
    - Declared schema at query time
    - State returned schema in response
    - Beacon to declare supported schema
    - Beacon to support a default schema for each entity
    - Support/rely on GA4GH entity schemas where available, e.g. phenopackets & schemaBlocks, variant representation
    - Ontologies
- Transversal features - details per dataset, hangovers, authn and access_levels, /filtering_terms, endpoint aliases 
- Push for schemaBlocks / phenopackets return schema, and enough information to populate.

### CINECA-wide use Case Document

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ePMJ5tnDDQbdhMVBfo4r2O_A9xMctL4scYYu_JSAs2Q/edit#
- Will be discussed at CINECA WP Leads meeting tomorrow
- Any feedback?
    - WP1 - only use case presented is for cohort identification and handoff to analysis
    - Important, but:
        - Handoff milestone is towards end of project
        - Want to be able to do simple analyses without calling workflow execution (does this virtual cohort have a higher mutational burden in gene X than this one?)
        - Portal developments in task 1.4

### What's next

- Reminder of CINECA WP1 milestones and deliverables:
    - MS1/D1.1 - Catalog of basic services (demo) - June 2020 (M18)
    - MS2/D1.2 - federated complex queries (demo) - Dec 2020 (M24)
    - MS4 - handoff to WP5 - June 2021 (M30)
    - MS3 - First training materials available - Dec 2021 (M36)
    - D1.3/MS5 - Distributed cohorts portals (demo), Dec 2022 (M48)
    - D1.4 - Data interoperability documentation, Dec 2022 (M48)

- For the service catalog, thereâ€™s an emerging GA4GH standard; do we go with that?  How implemented?
    - https://github.com/ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-service-info
    - https://github.com/ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-service-registry

- Shall we start bringing GA4GH discovery search back to our meetings regularly for extended query discussions?  Or should we attend those meetings?
    - Report back from GA4GH meeting and decide from there

- **TODO** - Cohorts to examine feasibility of map to schemaBlocks/phenopackets
- **TODO** - implemention plans from sites for Beacon 2

- Beacon Network -> Elixir service network
    - Likely aligned with service registry

## Upcoming Meetings

**Next meeting**

- Nov 4, usual time/zoom channel
- Will ask about updates on mailing list on Oct 24/25
