# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, Nov 2

## TODOs

- UCT to review ELIXIR AAI setup for beacon quickstart - does it adequately describe the steps you recently went through?
- CRG to report back to HES-SO re: possible use case for “vertical expansion” in CINECA
- CRG to discuss state of modelling for cohorts/datasets
- CanDIG to report back on discussions between WP1, WP3 for mapping synthetic data to beacon
- CRG to report back on extensible permissions server
- CanDIG to report back on Search GA4GH standards process - first product review committee meeting this week
- CRG to review MS1.2 documents, determine what is needed


## Review of TODOs

- Beacon quickstart for CINECA cohorts https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnZac4z6FiiiHSW5GXyMd-yOydqLU6aXEsEZ0ikz5nA/edit
    - CRG: Beacon Setup, Connect to Beacon Network sections
    - CanDIG: ELIXIR AAI section
        - Now done; UCT to review
    - CanDIG + WP3: discussions re: WP3 → phenopackets mapping
        - Discussions to start on Thursday re: working through the mapping with a given (probably CHILD) synthetic data set
    - CanDIG + CRG: discussions re: permissions server
        - Will have a simple permission server in beacon repo with extensions to allow it to support richer authorization
- HES-SO: demonstration next meeting re: query expansion
    - See below
- CanDIG to assemble template + requirements for Milestone 1.2
    - Done - see below
- CRG: discuss modelling for cohorts and update
    - TBD


## Query Expansion Demo

Aims to improve search via portal to improve user experience and return results as accurate as possible.   API driven - portal would call the API and then the WP1 APIs.

 Four key functionalities:

- “Horizontal expansion” between ontologies
    - Clear CINECA use case - so that each beacon (or search) endpoint doesn’t have to support all possible ontologies
    - Nice-to-have - could be limited to only those ontologies used (beacon returns ontologies supported)
- “Vertical expansion” from child to parent in ontologies, e.g. Gecko, 
    - Could be used to “even out” ontology use across cohorts
- Variant expansion
    - Translation between various formats (gene, protein, HGVS, rsid, VCF formats)
    - Could be used to make portal easier to use
- Data-driven: Word2vec based
    - Most natural with unstructured text?
    - Possible use with cohort-level descriptions in extended service registry?


## Next meetings
