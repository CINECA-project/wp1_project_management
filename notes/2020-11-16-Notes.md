# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, Nov 16

## TODOs

- CanDIG to contact CRG re: extensible permission server
- CanDIG to get poc.distributedgenomics.ca beacon back up and running and let CRG know as soon as it’s ready for MS1.2
- HES-SO to get beacon.text-analytics.ch beacon back up and running and let CRG know as soon as it’s ready for MS1.2
- CRG, HES-SO to set up a meeting
- CanDIG, CRG to set up a meeting w/ next steps for getting CHILD synthetic data in a beacon


## Review of TODOs

- CRG to report back to HES-SO re: possible use case for “vertical expansion” in CINECA
    - “Fuzzy filter”/similarity filter - especially of interest for rare disease use cases
- CRG, CanDIG to report back on discussions between WP1, WP3 for mapping synthetic data to beacon
    - Three different kinds of data “mapping”
        1. Cohort-level data - not really mapping; cohort does/doesn’t have data type X, basic statistics and information about the cohort
        2. Beacon “mapping” functionality - automated translation of filtering terms - does not affect returned values, only used in filtering
        3. Participant-level clinical/phenotpypic data “mapping” - taking cohort’s partipant-level clinical/phenotypic data and ingesting it into Beacon’s phenopackets-based ata model
    - WP3 minimal data model addresses the first.  Second is internal to beacon (and will be assisted by query expansion).  Third will be cohort-by-cohort, with each cohort’s participant-level data likely quite different.

- CRG to review MS1.2 documents, determine what is needed
    - Coming together, but we need the March AGM beacons back up and running!

- CanDIG to report back on Search GA4GH standards process - first product review committee meeting this week
    - Sent back with large number of clarification/documentation requests
    - Basic standard seems solid
    - Next meeting, Nov 30

- CRG to discuss state of modelling for cohorts/datasets
    - Interest in this from multiple stakeholders
    - Possible future beacon release

- UCT to review ELIXIR AAI setup for beacon quickstart - does it adequately describe the steps you recently went through?
    - CanDIG to follow up

- CRG to report back on extensible permissions server
    - CanDIG to follow up


## Other topics

- Anything needed for Query Expansion Deliverable Document?
    - Use cases clarified
    - /filtering_terms endpoint for known terminologies in a beacon


## Next meetings

- Nov 30 - WP1
- Nov 30 - GA4GH Search Product Review Committee mtg
