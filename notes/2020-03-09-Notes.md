# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, Mar 9

## Notes:

### Demo individual beacons

- CINECA beacon network: contact beacon team w/ deployment information as it becomes available.
- Best path forward for short-term implementation
    - Get data into database (script: github.com/ljdursi/agm_beacon ; `master` branch = as schema currently exists)
    - Add to schema
        - Weight, Height, tobacco, heart_rate: patient table
        - Separate tables for diseases and medications
        - (github.com/ljdursi/agm_beacon ; `new_tables` branch)
- CHILD database will be longitudinal - height, weight, heartrate will have to go somewhere else
- Aim for phenopackets, which means avoid Boolean fields
