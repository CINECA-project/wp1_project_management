# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, Feb 10

## Notes:

Note: We’ve moved our github organization to be a CINECA-wide organization, done the necessary renaming, and created a WP1 team.  The new name of the organization is CINECA-Project, and the repo we’ve been using for meeting notes is CINECA-project/wp1_project_management.

**Tasks:** https://github.com/orgs/CINECA-Project/projects/1

- Colaus WP3-formatted Beacon 
    - Technical seminar w/ Beacon v2 Feb 19
    - Want to talk with Beacon team about ingesting the beacon
    - Then map CoLaus WP3-mapped data into beacon v2
    - Beacon v2 team working on reference implementation, with example data
    - For v1-backward compatible queries, should be straightforward
    - For new v2 functionality, will have to figure out new data
- CanDIG beacon AAI interoperability
    - Progress via WP2
    - HES-SO also working on this for CoLaus - arrange to coordinate

    - As with CoLaus, investigating Beacon v2 reference implementation and figuring out where to put WP3-formatted metadata.
- Other (non-CINCEA) cohort plans for participating:
    - UMCG 
    - EGA
    - No update yet, not necessary for Mar demo but planning useful for Mid Term Report demo (see below)

Proposed mid-term review (~Oct) goals:

- Core Goals
    - Beacon V1 network demonstrator across one Canadian, one European, and one African cohort (WP3 dependency)
    - Search API for 2 cohorts with a subset of synthetic cohort data reflecting initial use cases
- Stretch Goals
    - Beacon V1 for three Canadian, three European, and one African cohort
    - Beacon V2 network across one Canadian, one European, and one African cohort 
    - Registered access individual level queries for one Canadian, one European, and one African cohort (WP2 dependency)
    - Controlled access individual level queries for one Canadian, one European, and one African cohort (WP2 dependency)
    - Demo of CINECA discovery portal
- Potential blockers
    - Beacon V2 specification not stable or published or adopted before the mid term
    - Search API
    - WP3 meta data not available, use synthetic meta data where needed (confirmed for CHILD cohort study) 

No objections
