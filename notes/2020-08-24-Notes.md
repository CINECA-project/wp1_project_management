## Notes

### Review of TODOs

- CanDIG to finish permissions service
    - Done: https://github.com/ljdursi/beacon_permission_service
- CanDIG to find phenopackets clients
    - Done Nothing really relevant outside of official libraries (python, Java): https://github.com/phenopackets/phenopacket-schema
- CanDIG to send HES-SO links for deliverables
    - Done
- HES-SO, CanDIG, H3Africa
    - TBD: Will jointly work on scripts to ingest WP3 standard metadata into extended tables for phenopackets when information updated by CRG
- CanDIG, H3Africa
    - In progress: talk about deployment plans


### Updates

- CRG:
    - Updating implemetation (`refactoring` branch)
    - Formatting response into phenopackets
    - Has a (likely imperfect) mapping between existing fields and pehnopackets
    - Plan is to largely finish initial development by end of week, finished by next Wednesday
    - Will be testing permissions
- HES-SO
    - Beacon now available under ELIXIR AAI
    - Apache as a rverse proxy
    - Discussions about implementing authentication; would prefer to have JWT from beacon which can be interrogated directly
    - Clarification about whose job it is to add permission server call to Beacon → Beacon development team
- CanDIG
    - No further updates other than above
- WP3
    - No updates

### Plan for Demo

- Discuss beacon development plan
    - Feature freeze Sept 7, giving sites 2 weeks to have correctly deployed, configured, and populated with data
    - Aim is for phenopackets support by end of August, authorization support earlier
    - CRG to send around phenopackets columns
- Disuss authentication and authorization plan
    - As above
    - Beacon API will be updated but not UI

## Next meetings

- Sept 7 - WP1
- Sept 8 - WPL pre-MTR meeting
