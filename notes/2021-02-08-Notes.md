# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, 8 Feb

# TODOs

For next meeting

- CRG to identify common fields between synthetic data sets
- CanDIG to initiate a meeting w/ SFU about those fields and get ready for data ingestion
- CRG to initiate a meeting with HES-SO re: data ingest problems - issues with script from last time
    - CanDIG, UCT to attend - make sure we understand what issues are for Synthetic Canada, Africa cohorts
    - CanDIG to write up information in “lighting a CINECA beacon” document
- CanDIG to connect w/ CRG re: permission server

Longer term

- CRG to take upcoming GA4GH Beacon presentation about adding cohort information and turn it into a blog post for CINECA WP6, highlighting how WP1 is “exporting” what we’ve learned and need to GA4GH for wider use


# Notes

## Review of TODOs

- CRG to identify common fields between the synthetic data sets
    - In progress
- CanDIG to work with SFU on script to ingest those fields into beacon for synthetic Canada, synthetic Africa datasets
    - Pending above
- HES-SO to continue debugging their ingestion script
    - Need some help from CRG - need technical documentation on both the script and database side
    - Also an issue w/ APIs which may just be a caching or HA issue in front of API server
- CanDIG to report on permission server
    - rego script to understand, validate GA4GH passport coming into place
    - Next step - to talk with CRG about incorporating and deploying this
- WP6 to let us know result of planning/brainstorming when done
    - Delivery programme is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jsaSTHv2ofknriTkqb7oJKjgFFo55eg-y90Is4MeFdQ/edit)
- CanDIG to find previous schemas for cohort data and send it to CRG

## Upcoming Demo

- UTartu to work with CRG on Synthetic UK data (or open 1000 genomes RNAseq data) to augment with needed metadata
    - This will help demonstrate handoff
- WP1: 20 min for our demo - plan is to be boring!
    - Beacon works with beacon network
    - Subset of synthetic data set fields
    - Plan for incorporating more fields
    - Works w/ WP2 authentication
    - Lighting CINECA beacon document status
    - Maybe a demo of not-yet-GA4GH Search on one dataset if time permits

## New Item WP1 Blog

- CINECA looking for blog post connecting GA4GH + CINECA
- Will try to repurpose upcoming CRG Beacon presentation into blog post

## Planning for first half of 2021

- End-to-end demos - ~March 2021: Authenticated, authorized access to federated beacon, with handoff to upstream WPs
    - Don’t need to harmonize data representation (e.g. ontologies) - WP3 will do this post demo
    - Synthetic data generated by CHILD in beacon hosted on CanDIG
        - (Waiting on mapping)
    - Synthetic data generated by Colaus in beacon hosted @ HES-SO
        - (Partly done, but some data didn’t make it into the beacon)
        - Will investigate the script
    - Synthetic data generated by H3Africa in beacon hosted @ UCT
        - (Waiting on mapping)
    - At each beacon,
        - Data mapped, Data ingested, Cohort metadata provided
        - Permission server understanding ga4gh passports deployed
        - Authorization implemented to enable registered (via passport), controlled, or open access as needed
    - Same data also provided by Search for one or more cohorts
    - Beacon network connecting all beacons
    - Service registry served by beacon network
    - Plan for handoff of beacon results to WPs4,5
    - Complete documentation for standing up CINECA WP1 APIs for other CINECA cohorts
        - CINECA beacon [quickstart](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnZac4z6FiiiHSW5GXyMd-yOydqLU6aXEsEZ0ikz5nA/edit)

- Need documentation and persistent infrastructure as we put this together
    - Demo should be a demo of functionality that persists and is replicable after the demo

## Next meetings

- Feb 22 - WP1 meeting
