# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, Apr 20

## TODOs

- CRG
    - Propose demo “script” for MS1.1/D1.1 service registry demonstrator for next meeting
        - Can be based on AGM work
        - Mostly demonstrate service registry of beacon network, but use to make one simple query of individual beacons
        - CRG to perform the demonstration
    - Document how to extend reference beacon v2
- HES-SO - propose 3-5 specific queries for midterm report
    - Intersection of queries supported by data + high-level queries defined at end of last year (https://github.com/CINECA-project/wp1_project_management/blob/master/queries.md)
    - For December query expansion deliverable - target same queries
- CanDIG:
    - Be prepared to stand up beacon again
    - Push forward work for Discovery Search
    - Maintain, extend python code to ingest WP3 data (https://github.com/CINECA-project/wp1-agm_beacon)
- WPL - speak with WP3, CINECA project management to make sure plans for MTR align with their plans
- June milestone & deliverable document and proposed reviewer candidates - joint responsibility between SickKids & CRG?

## Notes

### Upcoming Milestones and Deliverables

- MS1.1/D1.1 Service Registry - June (lead: Sickkids)
    - Should CRG be owner on discovery tasks?
    - Discovery: Service registry built into beacon network
    - Document template: https://docs.google.com/document/d/14EHEojiRzYLrodqEe5lpN7BHWuYPEstC-dtlN0vQXSk
- Mid-term review - Sep/Oct
    - Beacon V2 w/ phenopackets
        - Whose responsibility to implement - verify w/ beacon team
            - HES-SO, CanDIG: work on standard way of importing data into, extending v2 reference beacon
            - Can use python code from AGM demo as starting point: https://github.com/CINECA-project/wp1-agm_beacon
            - CRG Beacon team: document how to extend v2 reference beacon
        - Reference implementation alrady supports phenopackets
    - Search API, UI
        - DNAstack has open-sourced their front end to the search API:
            - https://github.com/DNAstack/ga4gh-search-adapter-presto
    - Open, registered, controlled access demo
        - HES-SO, CanDIG meeting last Friday
            - Clear next steps
            - HES-SO
                - Switch AAI - integrated into ELIXIR
                - Target open, registered access for demo: controlled access would take more work and might be a one-off if it happens
            - CanDIG: controlled is straightforward, open + registered more work
    - Discovery portal
        - Existing beacon network UI + improvements
- MS1.2 Federated discovery across registry services - Dec (lead: Sickkids)
    - Discovery: Built into beacon network 
- D1.2 Query Expansion Services - Dec (lead: HES-SO)
    - HES-SO comfortable with this
    - Align with queries we will be working on for mid-term

### Review Tasks https://github.com/orgs/CINECA-Project/projects/1
