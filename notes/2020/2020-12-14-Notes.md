# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, Dec 14

## TODOs

- WP6 to send us a list of what is current training offerings are so we can judge a useful time
- HES-SO to propose a couple of training possibilities - could be as simple as a technical report or a video of a slightly longer technical walkthrough
- After that, HES-SO, CRG will plan for future training, possibly more interactive, with both query expansion + Beacon
- CanDIG to finish getting poc.distributedgenomics.ca beacon back up and running (pending from last meeting)
- CanDIG to finish initial ga4gh passport permission server (pending from last meeting)
- HES-SO to get beacon back up and running (pending from last meeting)
- CRG to continue work developing mapping into beacon data model, ontologies, for synthetic data set developed by CHILD cohort team
