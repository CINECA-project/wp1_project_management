## Notes

### Review of TODOs

- CanDIG, CRG to coordinate on beacon/permissions API “protocol” and CanDIG to implement in OPA
    - Almost there: https://github.com/ljdursi/beacon_permission_service
- CRG to send list of fields (for phenopackets support) to list so sites/cohorts can ensure that data is populated
    - TBD: CRG team on holidays this week
- Stay in contact w/ WP4 and have people attend each other’s meetings (WP4: Tues at 2:30 UK time, on non-WP1-meeting weeks)  as required for collaboration
    - In progress - feedback on requirements for WP1 APIs here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tBg8bqnp4oxdavrA0dCkCZtGxS3v5Up-7cgHRUSlmMs/edit?ts=5ea84d31
- CanDIG to look into clients that can consume phenopackets data for demo
    - In progress

### Updates

- HES-SO
    - HES-SO and CRG teams in conversation about token handling
    - GA4GH passport + ELIXIR AAI authentication in place
    - Creating synthetic data for CoLaus with for demonstration
    - Use chromosome 22 for synthetic variants data 
    - Working on query expansion, would like information about what deliverable requirements are - CanDIG to send
- CanDIG
    - Working on permissions service for beacon, will make it relatively simple to securely update policies per site
    - Getting read to re-deploy beacon w/ synthetic CHILD data
- WP3 
    - Working on strategy for text mining, normalization. 
    - Developing more robust schema for cohort-level metadata

Questions: 

- Minimal metadata synthetic biosample data - possible source of synthetic data from supplementary?
- From WP3: not necessary for cohorts that don’t have such biosample data.  Example data does exist if needed


### Plan for Demo

- Discuss beacon development plan
    - Feature freeze Sept 7, giving sites 2 weeks to have correctly deployed, configured, and populated with data
    - Aim is for phenopackets support by end of August, authorization support earlier
    - CRG to send around phenopackets columns
- Disuss authentication and authorization plan
    - As above
    - Beacon API will be updated but not UI


## Next meetings

- Aug 24 - WP1
