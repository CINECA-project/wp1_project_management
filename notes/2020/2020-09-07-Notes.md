# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, Sept 7

## TODOs

- CanDIG, HES-SO, UCT: Test updated beacon
    - All: Deploy test beacon setup and make sure works, report back ASAP if problems
        - Zoom call this Wednesday at usual WP1 time to check in, to work through AAI connections
    - CanDIG to communicate with UCT
    - HES-SO Examine new database tables/columns and mapping of data to them
        - https://github.com/cineca-project/wp1-agm_beacon may or may not be good starting point
    - HES-SO, CanDIG: examine how to wire up updated beacon to existing AAI infrastructure

## Notes

### Review of TODOs

- CRG: Forward beacon â†” phenopackets document
    - Emailed to the CINECA WP1 list
- CRG: let deploying sites know when code is ready for testing
    - Integrated into default branch - https://github.com/ega-archive/beacon-2.x
- CanDIG: Forward WP6 team recommendations on demonstrator video to HES-SO
    - Done
- CanDIG, HES-SO, UCT: Test updated beacon when available (middle of next week)
    - To be done now

### Updates:

- CRG
    - Software now committed to default branch at https://github.com/ega-archive/beacon-2.x
    - Phenopackets format supported if requested (only one format is provided in response)
    - Test data, including GiaB data, is provided
    - So is mock IdP, permissions server
    - No real UI at this point - demo which provides token, can be used to test API (curl command provided)
    - Note that connecting to out-of-docker network services requires additional work - one fix suggested in README involving DNS entries

### Plan for Demo

- Similar to AGM demo, but with updated beacon and support for registered, controlled access
