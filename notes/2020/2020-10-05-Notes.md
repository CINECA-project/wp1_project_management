# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, Oct 5

## TODOs

For next meeting:

- HES-SO and CanDIG: contact WP3 and report back
    - Synthetic data status
    - WP3 → beacon tables mapping
- CRG: beacon modelling for cohort level responses
    - Aim to restore a cohorts-level metadata endpoint in beaconv2
    - Requires clarifying data modelling: dataset vs cohort
- CanDIG: contact WP2 and report back
    - Ensure documentation for setting up an elixir AAI client
- CRG + CanDIG: permissions server next steps
    - Discuss next steps for permissions servers

MTR Retrospective:


- Positives:
    - Reviewers, project admin happy
    - Built a lot of pieces we need
- Negatives
    - Lack of demo disappointing given amount of work
    - Unclear and shifting requirements
    - Longer to set up AAI than expected
- Need more intermediate deadlines


**Goals for upcoming year:**

- Discovery (Task 1.1.1)
    - Support other sites, cohorts (including synthetic cohorts) deploying emerging Beacon 2.x standard
- Analysis (Task 1.1.2)
    - Integrate Search into WP2 AAI
    - As with Discovery, support other sites, cohorts deployment
- Service Catalog (Task 1.2)
    - Deploy CINECA-wide service catalog that covers all CINECA services
- Federated Queries (Task 1.3)
    - Implement query federation atop standardized fields in Search queries
- Portals (Task 1.4.1)
    - As query APIs mature, develop user-facing portals built atop of those APIs
- Query expansion services (Task 1.4.2)
    - Allow closer to natural language searching support for WP1 queries

**What we’d like to build towards for beacon in the coming months:**


- Updated synthetic cohorts
    - Persistent URL & beacon
- Real cohorts data
- Quickstart for new cohort
    - Setting up beacon
        - Configuration
        - Datasets
        - URL to beacon-network
    - Ingesting data into beacon - WP1
        - Mapping
        - Ontology
        - Testing for deployed beacon - how do I know it works/ingest was successful (am I missing anything?)
            - Can be done w/ WP3 fields
        - Compliance testing
    - Setting up Elixir AAI — WP2
    - Setting up permissions
- Production strength permissions
- UCT AAI

Next steps for beacon:


- UCT AAI
- Permissions server
- Cohorts-level metadata endpoint in beaconv2
- starting a conversation WP3 on mapping into beacon tables
- starting a conversation WP2 setting up elixir AAI
- starting outreach to a number of cohorts (later)
- start getting latest version of synthetic data up - WP3
    - Child
    - Colaus
- *stable* instances of beacons
    - Getting commitments from sites:
        - current version of beacon
        - current version of data
        - CanDIG/CHILD - stable, will announce changes
        - HES-SO/Colaus - stable, will announce changes
    
## Next meetings
