# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes: 25 Feb 2019

## Notes

* (re)introductions
    - CanDIG - API-driven federated genomics and health data 
    - UCMG participate in projects like BBMRI, Molgenis: catalogs, platform for omics data, REST APIs
    - Swiss personalized health network - distributed metadata catalog; text mining, natural language mining
    - CSC - Hub in finland for computing services for academic users; host ELIXIR Finland; ELXIR AAI
    - CRG - EGA, involved with local EGA project; projcets such as Beacon

* What we have to do overcoming months
    - Requirements:
        - Define, implement, and having running local queries for data discovery (milestone: M12 = Dec 2020); 
        - Extending the query APIs to allow for more complex queries (milestone, M18); 
            - Not so much more complex queries as return types 
            - e.g, return histograms, matrices of results from the queried data
        - Working on a service catalog of such services (staring M12); and
        - Having the extended queries registered in the service registry (deliverable: M18).
    - Questions/issues for us to address
        - What are the scope of the services?
            - For us to decide, subject to needs of other work packages
        - Moving target - we may want to take existing use cases from the existing individual services
        - Build on Beacon project, or Discovery Search?
        - Federation-of-federations, or one federation?
            - Federation-of-federations would be less intrusive; let us try proceeding on that model

* Links to other WPs:
    - WP2: AAI
        - OIDC, will need to agree on claims and how the claims are provided
        - AAI can provide attributes and authorizations of researcher to sites
        - Elixir AAI has experience with beacons
            - BBMRI - not currently part of Elixir AAI, part of Life Sciences AAI
            - Discussions on interoperability underway
    - WP3: Metadata
        - Will need to support searching over the required metadata fields
    - WP4: Cohort analyses
        - Data discovery handoff for dynamically-defined cohorts
        - Should lean heavily on GA4GH - interoperable cloud platforms
    - WP5: Clinical Applications
        - Must support their use case
        - Effectiveness of treatment for a given condition for with given variants + phenotypes
    - WP6: Outreach
        - Portals for outreach?
        - Help with training
    - WP7&9: ELSI
    - We have at least some degree of participation from WPs 2,3,4,5 in this group
        - Expect that this overlap of participants should help keep us aligned
        - Explicit discussions pairwise between work packages on particular issues, as needed

* Current Discovery participation and status
    - We will do much of the technical implementation as part of discovery work streams
    - https://ga4gh-discovery.github.io
    - https://github.com/ga4gh-discovery
    - Meeting minutes notes: https://w3id.org/ga4gh/minutes/discovery
    - Email Rishi Nag (rishi.nag @ ga4gh.org) to join Discovery mailing lists - Search, Beacon, Networks

* Fields we want to query on in initial iterations
    - Google doc: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KXpdgtDf0RRAyga6EJfBSxbUwAV0oR_DGP9R9-42D84/edit
    - Importance of figuring out use cases, to drive fields, return types

* Next call / initial call frequency?
    - Two weeks from now while determining scope, fields, approaches

* Next meeting
    - Mar 11, 2019 14h GMT
