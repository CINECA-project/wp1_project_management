### Other Business
- WP4: requirements for WP1 APIs:
    - Their queries consist of “generic cohort queries”
        - List phenotypes within the cohort
        - Return number of case samples
        - Return number of control samples
        - Available APIs (e.g. htsget, GA4GH AAI / Passports etc) supported by the cohort
        - Data Use Restrictions on a cohort
    - Data queries
        - Return samples with specific phenotype within the cohort
    - And different types of data to be returned
        - genotype data
        - RNA-seq data
        - cell type or tissue
        - RNA-seq data format (CRAM vs BAM vs FASTQ)
        - genotype data format
        - genotype reference genome
        - phenotype data
    - Will follow up with WP4 lead and we can discuss next meeting
