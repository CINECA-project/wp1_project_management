- All others to promptly edit the text, making additions/changes/integration as needed

**Portal**

- McGill to consider locally-motivated use cases for Beacon visualization, initially for a single beacon
- Work on network (CRG), query expansion (HES-SO) to continue in parallel

**CINECA-wide meeting in March**

- CRG, CanDIG to start assembling KPIs

**Data mapping**

- CRG to meet w/ WP3 and EGA team to cover previously-existing mapping to beacon (UK-1 cohort) for suitability more CINECA-wide

# Notes

## Welcome, Introductions

## Beacon v2

- GA4GH will almost certainly approve in first half this year
- Very unlikely that the API changes much
- Some question about the exact structure of the data models - but even those wouldn’t change much
- Work can proceed

## Portal

- Discussion about staging of work - visualization vs query expansion vs network
- Little dependency at this stage of work
    - Final visualization tools will need the network, but will always be able to visualize an individual beacon
    - Query expansion could take place at any time, potentially even before the queries out to the network

## Mapping deeper fields w/ WP3

- CRG is arranging a meeting w/ WP3 and team that has already mapped an existing CINECA cohort to Beacon v2 - try to make use of as much of existing work as possible


## Midterm report and annual meeting

- Annual meeting in March
- Internal midterm report deadlines start Jan 21st
- WP1’s version (copied from last MTR) is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EOygfEYBrYDbOaLMjskCeq-Jxv3ms2oC8c5MqxnPmQg/edit#heading=h.30j0zll)
