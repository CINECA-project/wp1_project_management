    - D1.2, Query Expansion Services, Demonstrator, Lead: HES-SO, M24 (Dec)

### WP1/3 Demo (mid Mar)

* Beacon
    - Three cohorts
        - CanDIG/CHILD
        - SIB & HES-SO/CoLaus
        - EGA â€¦  
    - Beacon network
        - CINECA beacon network already started
    - Interoperable AAI (?)
    - Beacon ref implement has successfully ingested other schemas in the past
    - Beacon v2 draft
* Discovery Search/Tables API
    - CanDIG/CHILD
    - Second cohort?
* Search API still much less mature API
    - Having something concrete would be useful for gaining input at early stage
* Demo will be topic of WP coordination meeting Jan 15
    - Get feedback from WP5 about what would be a useful demonstration

### MS 1.1/D1.1 Service registry implementation (M18)

* Stand up somewhere, can list demo Beacons/Search from above
    - Demonstrator deliverable
    - Lead Beneficiary: SickKids
    - Deliverable owner need not be from institutional lead
    - Will need a deliverable reviewer
    - Built into Beacon Network

### D1.2: Query expansion services (M24)

* Lead: HES-SO; Contributors: SFU, CRG
    - Expand queries in the portal
    - Support information retrieval queries
        - Biomedical terms
    - Aligned with WP3, but can perform independently

### MS1.2 Federated discovery demonstrator (M24)

* Demo will go long way to this milestone
