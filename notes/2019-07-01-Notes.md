# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, 1 July 2019

## Summary

We discussed the criteria themselves, and how the various APIs being examined meet the criteria. We will set up a google doc matrix of criteria vs APIs and evaluate at our next meeting.

Additional criteria proposed and adopted:

* Feasibility of fine-grained authorization
* Discovery of metadata
* Clear API
* Support for semantic models/ontologies
* Reusable in other projects (EUCAN-Connect)
* Agile, prototype API as soon as possible
* Does not require additional infrastructure

## Action items
* Jonathan to set up google docs matrix for each service/site to fill in
* Everyone to fill out the matrix when circulated in advance of next meeting (July 15)
* Questions remain as to desirability of WP3s request for loose coupling between API & schema
    - Jonathan to set up WP1/3 meeting and invite interested group members to attend
* What are WP4 requirements for handoff?  (Milestone 1.4, month 30)
    - Jonathan to set up WP1/4 meeting and invite interested group members to attend

## Next meeting
* Following call 15 July
    - Will evaluate the filled-in matrix and make initial choice

## Notes

Molgenis:

* Uses RSQL to decouple query from data model
* Can make queries one relation “deep”
* Can do aggregations on categorical data
* Can do ranked search w/ Elastic search

Beacon:

* Extendable, common query definitions
* Started w/ discovery based on variants, growing to richer queries
* Evidence beacon
* Not designed for complex queries
* Will adopt bioschemas 
* GA4GH standard
* Backend agnostic
* Beacon 2.0 - expected to be submitted as a standard two steering committee meetings from now
* Beacon serves as an interconnection point
* Allows you to define structure of return data

SwissEGA

* Always return lists
* Metadata model: DATS.  “Competency queries’
* Information Retrieval vs Data Retrieval
* Less coupled in metadata
* Uses reference ontology: UMLS on ingestion
* Working on alignment w/ SchemaBlocks
* Datamed.org; 2.3M datasets, 75 dataset repositories
* MyHealthMyData, SPHN
* Model validation tools: https://github.com/datatagsuite/dats-tools/tree/master/dats
* Separate infrastructure - data meatadata needs to be converted to DATS
* Demo: http://candy.hesge.ch/SwissEGA/

Discovery Search:

* SQL over arbitrary tables w/ provided (possibly externally defined) schemas makes all example queries possible albeit (contingency table example) possibly with multiple calls
* Multiple places for allowing mapping:
    1. At the level of the individual underlying service: calculated values + views for a database or API shims for incorporated APIs
    2. Between PRESTO and the service in the PRESTO connector
    3. In the service itself after the PRESTO query - requires bilateral translation between schemas
    4. In an API shim between the Discovery Search API and the external user.
    - Closer to the data (e.g., case a) is probably most avantageous
* If the underlying service uses relatively common SQL databases, connecting to the reference implementation is quite straightforward.  For non-relational databases, if the schema varies quite significantly between objects, some normalization or projection may need to happen. To connect to an underlying API, a connector will have to be written in a JVM language. 
* While the API and reference implementation is still evolving, there are a small number of implementations in production.
* Under active development by a GA4GH workstream.
