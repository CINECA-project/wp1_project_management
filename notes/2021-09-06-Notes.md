CRG:
- Follow up w/ WP6 in a month re: e2e training planning DONE
    - Learning pathway: ELSI, find data, access data, harmonise metadata, federated data analysis
    - WP1: find data (beacon, query expansion)
    - Can we recycle existing training?  First training materials - aiming for January
    - New training materials (e.g. portal) should be able to plug into this framework.

McGill
- Review Beacon v2 framework (https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-framework-v2) and consider for implementability BRING UP NEXT WEEK

## CINECA End To End Training

- Steer towards fitting new training materials into the “learning pathway” above
    - ELSI, find data, access data, harmonise metadata, federated data analysis
- CRG followed up with WP6:
    - Integrate query expansion into “find data”
    - Clarify diagarams
    - Should harmonizing metadata be before data?  In particular, is the learning path for users or implementors?
    - Option for implementing beacon

## No Cost Extension:

- CRG to follow up on the proposal to *not* extend D1.4

## Priorities for remainder of 2021:

- Continue working on beacon training materials - training scheduled for Mid Nov
- Deliver lighting a beacon document by end of training, which will help more CINECA beacons get lit!
    - Mapping deeper fields (w/ WP3) - Meeting 3 Sept
    - Reference authorized beacon (w/ WP2)
- Continue ingesting data
- Continue working on query expansion training materials
- Continue working on beacon data visualization
- Working with WP5 on Task 5.2
