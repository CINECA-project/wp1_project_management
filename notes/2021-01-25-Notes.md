# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, 25 Jan

## TODOs

- CRG to identify common fields between the synthetic data sets
- CanDIG to work with SFU on script to ingest those fields into beacon for synthetic Canada, synthetic Africa datasets
- HES-SO to continue debugging their ingestion script
- CanDIG to report on 
- WP6 to let us know result of planning/brainstorming when done

# Notes

## Report back on Synthetic Data Meeting

- WP3 will work on harmonizing data into common ontologies
- It’s enough for us to map the common fields, bringing the data in with minimal transformation
- CRG to pick out common fields from across the cohorts to work on those
- SFU to work on data loading script once done

## Review of TODOs

- EGA to follow-up and get calendar/list of current offerings so we can design our own training 
    - WP6 to do the necessary planning and to share with us
- CRG to follow up with HES-SO, make sure they’re invited to CHILD/beacon meeting and get notes relevant to their work with synthetic data generated by CoLaus
    - Done
- CanDIG to have initial working permission server
    - Basics working, now working on passorts
- Attendees to report back on cross-workpackage meeting, synthetic data meeting, CHILD/beacon meeting
    - As above

## Planning for first half of 2021

- End-to-end demos - ~March 2021: Authenticated, authorized access to federated beacon, with handoff to upstream WPs
    - Don’t need to harmonize data representation (e.g. ontologies) - WP3 will do this post demo
    - Synthetic data generated by CHILD in beacon hosted on CanDIG
        - (Waiting on mapping)
    - Synthetic data generated by Colaus in beacon hosted @ HES-SO
        - (Partly done, but some data didn’t make it into the beacon)
        - Will investigate the script
    - Synthetic data generated by H3Africa in beacon hosted @ UCT
        - (Waiting on mapping)
    - At each beacon,
        - Data mapped, Data ingested, Cohort metadata provided
        - Permission server understanding ga4gh passports deployed
        - Authorization implemented to enable registered (via passport), controlled, or open access as needed
    - Same data also provided by Search for one or more cohorts
    - Beacon network connecting all beacons
    - Service registry served by beacon network
    - Plan for handoff of beacon results to WPs4,5
    - Complete documentation for standing up CINECA WP1 APIs for other CINECA cohorts
        - CINECA beacon [quickstart](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnZac4z6FiiiHSW5GXyMd-yOydqLU6aXEsEZ0ikz5nA/edit)

- Need documentation and persistent infrastructure as we put this together
    - Demo should be a demo of functionality that persists and is replicable after the demo

## Next meetings

- Feb 8 - WP1 meeting
