# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, 12 July

## TODOs

- CRG:
  - Follow up with technical team on feasibility of geolocation of beacon network queries, logging number of queries
  - Schedule follow up meeting/ w mapping workgroup
- CRG, McGill:
  - Develop timeline, plan for portal development
- SickKids/UHN:
  - Report back on progress with reference authorized beacon
- Work package leads:
  - To assign tasks for quarterly reporting
  - To assemble a list of people who can review for WP1 in November
  - To find someone to attend WP6 end-to-end training planning
- All:
  - Complete quarterly reporting text for next meeting, where weâ€™ll review

## Priorities for remainder of 2021

- Work on lighting a beacon document, which will help more CINECA beacons get lit!
  - Mapping deeper fields (w/ WP3)
  - Reference authorized beacon (w/ WP2)
- Continue ingesting data
- Continue working on training materials
- Continue working on beacon data visualization

## Review of TODOs

- CRG: next steps with WP3 on mapping more fields in UKBB, CHILD
  - Small working group form
  - Tasks assigned for mapping of most common variables
  - Will regroup and end of month
- HES-SO: identify further needs of WP5 for synthetic data, and beacon training
  - Meetings in progress
- SickKids/UHN: report next meeting on simple reference authorized beacon w/ permission server
  - Progress for simple identity provider - will coordinate w/ WP2 on ELIXIR AAI/passports

## Extend timelines for 6-month no-cost extension?

- If CINECA were extended by 6 months, would we want to extend our timelines?
  - As foundational WP, others depend on us completing our tasks
  - Big remaining deliverables - portal - should be readily completable by M48
  - UCT: beacon should be complete
- **Decision** - do not extend timelines

## WP1 KPIs

- Some possibilities:
  - Size (in number of datasets) of beacon network
  - Number of data subjects in beacons
  - Number of beacon requests
- Other suggestions:
  - Global distribution of queries
  - Queries particularly across the beacon network are of interest rather than standalone beacons (although standalone beacons query counts are of interest for the sites hosting them)
  - Size (in cohorts) of beacon network should be readily available from (extended) service registry once cohort beacon is registered with the network
  - Portal views would be an option later on
- **Decision**: will report for KPIs:
  - Number of queries to beacon network
  - breakdown by location if feasible - CRG to find out about feasibility
  - beacons (and cohorts) in beacon network
