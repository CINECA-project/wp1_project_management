# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, 12 Aug

## Notes

HES-SO’s experience standing up beacon using standard docker images, and the path forward

- CoLaus Cohort
    - Don’t yet have access to full genetic data; using synthetic data initially
    - Using clinical data + synthetic VCFs
- Collaboration with CRG
    - Visit from CRG; presentation of Beacon API, Docker deployment
    - Good documentation for deployment online
        - Swagger API
- Docker Deployment
    - https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-elixir
    - Https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/specification
    - Beacon front end: VCFs
        - Configure conf.ini
    - Java software: dev.properties
        - Java 1.0.1
        - Controlled access rights: has support for setting data sets as  open/registered/controlled
        - Responsibility of the site to implement the controlled access
    - Postgres database: /beacon-data
        - External database used to persist data between docker runs
        - Comes with example data, using that
        - Provides a script that parses VCFs and prepares data for ingest into Postgres
        - Can adapt beacon to use to
- Next steps
    - Include genetic information w/ CoLaus
    - Load data into Postgres
    - Update backend with access labels
    - Test API
    - Make available to WPs 1, 3, 5

Other sites to discuss status of their plans for standing up Beacon for M12

- CanDIG:
    - Has a search capability that looks a bit like GA4GH Case Discovery
    - Standing up v0.2 Beacon on top of that
    - Will also evaluate docker implementation
- RUG: 
    - Has v0.2 Beacon implementation already
    - Will be able to support 
- UTartu:
    - Also using Docker implementation (v1.0.1)
    - Not ingesting sample-level genotypes; only alleles and allele frequencies


## Upcoming

The next meeting, the 26th, we’ll hear from Sabela de la Torre, CRG, on:

- Recommended best practices for standing up a beacon from scratch
- What we should expect the Beacon standard to be as of Dec 2019

And continuing updates on sites re: Beacon
