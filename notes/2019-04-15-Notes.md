# CINECA WP1 Meeting Notes, 15 Apr 2019

## Notes

* Updates from other groups:
   - Response re: Queries
       - WP5: Would like us to have support for more clinical/phenotypic data:
           - Medical procedures
           - Variant interpretation
           - Outcome
           - Lab Work
           - Data modalities
           - Using, of course, appropriate ontologies (WP3)
       - WP3: Working on survey of common metadata
           - Relatedly,  EBI/Biosamples collaboration https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/ working on queries for biobank use-case
               - Implementing Discovery search queries
               - Will talk with them in Hinxton during GA4GH meeting
            - Combining phenotype + DUO + data
   - WP2: Still working on authZ processes survey
   - WP4: Not present

* Discussion of various site backends:
    - RD3:
        - Single Postgres DB with ~ dozen tables
        - Rare disease use cases: 
            - variant queries
            - track analysis & data provenance
            - patient registry
        - data models:
            - File, sample, dataset, subject, phenotype, disease, variant...
        - https://rd3.test.molgenis.org: demo/demo
        - Autogenerated user interfaces
        - REST APIs
        - RSQL syntax
            - https://github.com/jirutka/rsql-parser
        - CafeVariome
        - Also looking at DataShield as an API to support:
            - R-analysis of data as a service
            - A lot of work on relevant queries
   - CanDIG:
       - Currently, clin/phen, samples, & pipelines in a database with tables/schemas of our own design, largely cancer-based
       - Variants in indexed directory of indexed VCF
       - Custom query API connecting the two
           - Can perform both discovery queries and simple analyses/aggregations (counts, histograms)
       - Moving to FHIR db + Variant store
       - Inspired by work in Discovery search, evaluating PRESTO & 
       - https://github.com/CanDIG/presto-graphql-testbed
    - CSC:
        - Local EGA
        - Whole genome data w/ CRG 
        - Encrypted file w/ htsget
        - Beacon instance
        - Postgres DB
            - Variants & metadata
    - EGA:
        - Various solutions for variants at different volumes
            - Postgres > MongoDB > HBase
